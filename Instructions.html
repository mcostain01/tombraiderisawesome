            Tomb Raider (1996) is the first game in a 12 game series, excluding 2 spinoff titles. The story follows a woman named Lara Croft, an Archeologist/adventurer, who is approched by a mercenary named Jacqueline Natla, who wants Lara to go and collect a treasure from an old tomb, called the Scion. After collecting the Scion, and going to turn it in, it is revealed that she only has a piece of the Scion, and that there is another treasure hunter looking for the other pieces. Once collecting and killing the other treasure hunter, and putting the pieces together, Lara gets a vision of where the 3rd and final piece is. This is as much as I can say without giving away the ending, so if you would like see how the game ends, feel free to either play the game or watch someone else play on a video sharing platform.

            The game is a 3rd person game, with the camera sitting somewhere behind the protagonist almost constantly while playing. Because of the fact that it is a relatively old game, and it having a massive fan following, the game has been launched on multiple different consoles. I will be using the controls for the Playstation, to talk about how the game works. To move around, you use the d-pad (the d-pad is the + looking buttons on the remote) to select while direction you want to walk into. The Square button is jump, which allows you to do other things rather then jump directly up. There is also a seperate walk button, because you run by default. This walk button is R1, and allows you to walk through dangerous areas like broken glass without taking damage, or running of off ledges, because if you are running, Lara can fall off.
